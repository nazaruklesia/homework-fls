        <h2>Vilnius — More Than Just a Capital.</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Vilnius</b> is the capital of and largest city in
          <b>Lithuania</b> and the most-populous city in the Baltic states. The
          city's estimated January 2025 population was 607,404, and the Vilnius
          urban area (which extends beyond the city limits) has an estimated
          population of 747,864.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vilnius is notable for the architecture of its Old Town, considered
          one of Europe's largest and best-preserved old towns. The city was
          declared a <mark>UNESCO</mark> World Heritage Site in 1994. The
          architectural style known as Vilnian Baroque is named after the city,
          which is farthest to the east among Baroque cities and the largest
          such city north of the Alps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city was noted for its multicultural population during the
          Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with contemporary sources comparing it
          to Babylon. Before World War II and the Holocaust, Vilnius was one of
          Europe's most important Jewish centers. Its Jewish influence has led
          to its being called "the Jerusalem of Lithuania", and Napoleon called
          it "the Jerusalem of the North" when he passed through in 1812.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vilnius was a 2009 European Capital of Culture with Linz in Austria.
          In 2021, the city was named one of fDi's 25 Global Cities of the
          Future. Vilnius is considered a global financial centre, ranked 76th
          globally and 29th in Europe on the Global Financial Centres Index. The
          city is an important center for the global fintech industry. It hosted
          the 2023 <mark>NATO</mark> Summit. In 2025 Vilnius was the European
          Green Capital. Vilnius is a member of Eurocities and the Union of
          Capitals of the European Union <mark>(UCEU)</mark>.

            The symbol of Vilnius is visible from many spots in the Old Town and
            is portrayed in numerous works of art. It is one of the best places
            to see the magnificent panoramas of Vilnius. Climb Gediminas’ Hill
            and admire the sunset or go up even higher to the top of the
            Gediminas Tower for more spectacular views. The red roofs of
            Vilnius, the church towers, and the narrow streets of the Medieval
            Old Town are a stunning sight. The tower houses a historic
            exhibition displaying reconstruction models of the castles of
            Vilnius, an armament, and iconographic material of old Vilnius.

              Gediminas’ Castle Tower is the remaining fortification tower of
              the Upper Castle. Legend has it that the Grand Duke Gediminas
              dreamt of an Iron Wolf howling at the top of this hill, which he
              took as a prophecy of the great city that would one day stand in
              this place. The hill is where he eventually built a wooden castle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grand Duke Vytautas completed the city’s first brick castle in
              1409. Gediminas’ Tower has changed purposes since then, including
              being used as the city’s first telegraph building in 1838. The
              Lithuanian flag was first flown at the top of the tower a century
              ago. The Vilnius Castle Museum was opened in 1960, and in 1968 it
              became a subdivision of the Lithuanian National Museum.

            Standing atop the hill that bears its name, the Three Crosses
            memorial consists of three white reinforced concrete crosses that
            are visible from afar. Climb the hill and you’ll see vast panoramas
            of Vilnius Old Town. Plus, the Bernardine Garden and Vilnele River
            are right at the foot of the hill. This 12-metre tall monument has
            become a symbol of national identity, but the crosses themselves are
            often illuminated in different colours to commemorate special events
            for Lithuania and the world. So whenever you can see the monument
            while walking around the city after dark, take a look to see if it’s
            lit up in special colours.

              A wooden castle was built on the hill in the 12th and 13th
              centuries, and a settlement was later established in its place.
              The hill got its name after Franciscans died as martyrs when
              pagans tied them to crosses and threw them down the hill. The
              three crosses were erected to commemorate this event. The current
              monument was created by architect and sculptor A. Vivulskis in
              1916 and rebuilt in 1988.

            The castle is famous for its gothic architecture and its special
            location – it stands on an island on Lake Galve, one of the deepest
            lakes in Lithuania. The view of the historic structure is s traight
            out of a fairy tale. You can reach the castle by crossing the long
            wooden bridge. In the winter the lake freezes over and becomes a
            natural skating rink. You can also take in a special view of the
            castle from a yacht.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visit the museum inside the castle to explore the exhibitions of the
            Grand Dukes of Lithuania, various archaeological findings and
            artefacts, as well as a collection of art. In the summer there are
            medieval festivals as well as various events and concerts in the
            castle’s courtyard.

              The castle was built in the 14th century and served as a residence
              for the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. However, the structure fell into
              disarray in the 17th century and was only rebuilt in 1951. In
              1962, the castle became a part of the Trakai History Museum.
